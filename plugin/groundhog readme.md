# Groundhog v0.12.0 beta

*... a Grasshopper plugin, a set of reference models, and wiki exploring the applications of computational design in landscape architecture.*

#### Minimum Requirements

- Rhinoceros `6.0` on Windows or `6.0` on macOS.

#### Installation

- Open up Grasshopper, then in the "File" menu go to "Special Folders" > "Components Folder".
- Copy the plugin file `groundhog.gha` to this folder, then quit Rhinoceros.
- If you are on Windows right-click on the plugin file and open the properties tab. In that properties window, check if there is an 'unblock' option in the bottom right corner. If it exists, click it. If it doesn't exist, proceed through the next steps. For more details, [refer to this guide](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/delay/p/unblockingdownloadedfile/).
- Reopen Rhinoceros and Grasshopper. If the installation worked there should be a "Groundhog" tab present in Grasshopper's components toolbar.
