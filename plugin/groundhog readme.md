# Groundhog (0.7.0b)

*... a Grasshopper plugin, a set of reference models, and wiki exploring the applications of computational design in landscape architecture.*

#### Requirements

- Rhinoceros 5.0 / 6.0 (Windows) or Rhinoceros 5.4+ (Mac) and Grasshopper 0.9.0076+

#### Installation

- Open up Grasshopper, then in the "File" menu go to "Special Folders" and then "Components Folder"
- Copy the plugin file `groundhog.gha` to this folder, then quit Rhinoceros.
- If you are on Windows right-click on the plugin file, open the properties tab, then in the properties window click the unblock option in the bottom right corner. For more details, [refer to this guide](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/delay/p/unblockingdownloadedfile/).
- Reopen Rhinoceros and Grasshopper, if the installation worked there should be a "Groundhog" tab present in Grasshopper.
