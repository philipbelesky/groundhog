The first channel component, `Channel Region`, determines a water level for a given section and a given area of water. It allows different channel geometries to be tested against a particular capacity of water and thus quickly gauge the efficacy of different profile geometries.

The second channel component, `Channel Info`, calculates a number of hydraulic calculations from the sectional area determined by the `Channel Region` component. Most of these are geometric (e.g. *Mean Depth*) but a number of others can be calculated if the component is provided with a slope value and a [roughness coefficient](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/mannings-roughness-d_799.html) for the channel.
