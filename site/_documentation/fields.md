title:      Fields

This broad goal of being able to easily segue between intensive and extensive representations of material properties is what prompted this first 'field' component. It does so in a specific context: of mapping conditions in plan; and through a particular graphic technique and concept: that of field condition. Whereas many techniques exist for creating field-like visual representations using parametric modelling tools they often presuppose a dataset that itself is already intensive (say the normals of a surface) or use extensive measures to create abstract intensive relationships (say between an attractor point and a grid). What is different here is the effort to develop a consistent method for translating existing extensive geometric information in an intensive form and for codifying the resulting representation. The consistency in both measures then allows that field to become — like the grid — a tool for either extensive or intensive modes because it can be expressed in defined measures (that then enable correlations and optimisations to be madded) as well as in expressive forms (a heat map; a variably sized pattern) that better reflect the underlying landscape condition.
