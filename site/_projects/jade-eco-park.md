Three times of the size of Parc de la Villette, the design of the Jade Eco Park deal with its scale through an ambitious field-driven strategy where programme is distributed across a series of discovered and designed disrupted microclimates.[@Rahm:2014ew 83-84] It aims to produce a series of 11 'Climatic Lands' where "temperature, humidity and air pollution were intensively modified" by the manipulation of natural features (vegetation, topography, water) and the introduction of devices for conductive cooling, misting, dehumidifiers, and air-filtration.[@Rahm:2014ew 83] Each Land is to create a climatic intervention that can support a particular programme (ie cool spaces for leisure or dry spaces for sports) while the site as whole offers a "continuous cross-mixings of factors, generating multiple field conditions punctuated by intensities and singularities of difference, variety and variation in the distributions of factors."[@Rahm:2014ew 83]

Computational approaches to landscape-scale analysis and simulation drive this climatic design. Given the diversity of the desired atmosphered features, computational fluid dynamics tools (ANSYS Fluent in the case) were key to both stages: as the 'starting point' for understanding the atmospheric conditions on site and for assessing the proposed interventions.[@Chi:2016vp] Transsolar — a climate engineering firm — was responsible for this analysis.

Such atmospheric manipulation is a primary interest[@Walliss:2015uc 49] of one of the design's architects — Philippe Rahm — but underpinning it is landscape architect Catherine Mosbach's interest in topographic manipulations.[@Walliss:2015uc 52] This manifests in the use of a field-concept for design development, with topographic variation creating 'different gradients of porosity' that manage the capture, flow, infiltration, and recharge of surface run-off in according to the local soil characteristics, vegetation choices, and surface materials.[@Walliss:2016vy 52]

The use of a CFD as a tool to manipulate micro-climates is most clear in the designs for the folly-like spread across the park; yet the same results were also useful in calibrating the species and density of vegetation to the desired conditions.[@Chi:2016vp] However there are fewer details regarding how exactly Mosbach's design interests and areas of responsibility made use of these tools. For example, a discussion mentions the "submersion of bridges and tunnels crossing the park into the ground plane" that created "complex shapes and spaces" which were more easily developed in Rhinoceros than in plan and section.[@Walliss:2015uc 55] But many natural or terrestrial features are also cited as complicated, such as the vast differences in the 'coefficient of surface run-off'[@Walliss:2016vy 55] or the 'detailed planting regimes, featuring plants with particular performative attribute.'[@Walliss:2016vy 57]

Details of the approaches used to manage these kinds of complexities scant. While it is understandable that CFD strategies are beneficial to the atmospheric conditions of the park, the lithospheric conditions — the cross-scalar biological, chemical and physical elements of the ground — that characterise Mosbach's practice[@Walliss:2016vy 52] are no less complex nor performative. As with the *Max Lab IV* there was an optimisation strategy driven by topographic manipulation:

> "The topography unfolds and transforms as a series of creases, hollows and bumps structuring spaces, views, circulation and most importantly capturing rainfall and overland flow to encourage in infiltration and the recharging of the groundwater. These surface folds, influenced by parameters of drainage, soil porosity and the biological performance of vegetation, orchestrate the spatial and ecological organisation of the topographic surface."[@Walliss:2016vy 52]

...yet unlike the *Max Lab IV* it is harder to discern how these 'parameters' directly affected the design, or what design decisions beyond shaping surface forms also took these parameters into account. As with Max Lab IV, they could directly define conditions through parametric modelling, or like the CFD part of this project, the design features could be iterated upon according to simulated results. That neither option seems to have been used is not to suggest a deficiency in the design — parameterisation need not be explicit to be relevant — but at the point it is a major part of dealing with atmospheric complexity at scale how could it be applied to similar levels of ecological complexity?
