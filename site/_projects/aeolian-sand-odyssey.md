*Aeolian Sand Odyssey* documents the thesis year of a pair of students in the Architecture Association's Landscape Urbanism programme. This iteration of that thesis year emphasised an analysis of European landscapes at the territorial scale and features many projects that used simulations of landscape processes as an instrument for investigation.

Here, that took the form of testing the aeolian — wind-driven — processes of dune formation in a sand peninsular, roughly 100km in length, that lies between the Blatic Sea and a freshwater lagoon.[@Kotenko:2014th 1] As a point of departure the project sought to challenge the European Union's landscape preservation policies that seemed to focus more on arresting the dune movement and preserving particular pictorial qualities.[@Kotenko:tw 11] Instead they sought to work within the existing sociocultural context of the site and integrate dune management into how existing programmes, such as tourism, were evolving.

A key part of approaching this as a design problem was in building the capacity to simulate the formation and evolution of dune systems. To do so a cellular-automota based model, originally developed by Brad Werner, was employed.[@Kotenko:2014th 5] The model's key components are establishing a wind direction, wind velocity, grain size, grain variety, and a framework for representing dune topographies as a 3D grid of cells.[@Kotenko:2014th 5] These cells — the automata — follow a series of rules to enact dunal drift, primarily by determining if they are in the winds 'shade' — ie opposite the prevailing direction and moving them according to the slope of the dune's edges[@Kotenko:2014th 58]. The rules can then be iterated upon to project existing or hypothetical conditions into future states.

This tool was then run using site data and identified two major strategies for altering the dune's long term trajectory. First was a strategy that would tactically deploy vegetation and small 'soft' structures to on existing slopes of approximately 30 degrees such that they would accumulate sediments and stabilise at around 18° degrees over a six to nine year time period.[@Kotenko:2014th 58] Second was a strategy of deploying more substantial obstacles perpendicular to the drift path which would cause cresting around the obstacle; thus splaying and slowing the dune's spread. Niki and Anastasia talk of these simulation tools as intuition aids: as useful models for building up an understanding of the dune phenomena over a complex set of site conditions;[@Kotenko:tw 133] even though the results might be an 'approximate forecast'.[@Kotenko:tw 133]

It is interesting to consider how the models could have been more deeply integrated with the resulting design strategies. The simulation examples appear to work primarily at the level of morphology — as would be expected with the cells acting as terrain volumes — and primarily at the scale of small testing beds (3-4 isolated dunes) rather than necessarily being operative across the site itself. To the extent interventions were modelled, they also were depicted at a morphological level — as obstructing objects or as 'patches' of different material, which raises the possibility of how their performance characteristics could be evaluated on their own terms, or as a broader set of feedback to the initial model.
