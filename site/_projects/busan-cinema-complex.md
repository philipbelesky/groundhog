The 2006 competition entry for the *Busan Cinema Complex* by James Corner Field Operations and TEN Arquitectos demonstrates more simple, but more explicit, link between surface development strategies and particular performance goals.

Here a rectangular grid distributes a series of tiles across a surface, with the size and rotation of each element controlled using parametric relationships. The result is a graduated field where the tiles are smallest and most offset from their original horizontal orientation where the surface is highest. Presumably a series of parametric rules control these relationships, with each point in the grid sampling the topography's current vertical height dynamically. The logic of this is that the larger mounds contain subterranean bladders for storing run-off and/or storm water[@Hansen:2011tka] although the increased permeability at the peaks seems unrelated to the task of collecting run-off for the bladders — only that the tiles "subtly reveal [their] position."[@Hansen:2011tka] To the extent the tiles are performative it is seemingly as a marker of infrastructure, or providing differentiated surface materials for programmatic use.

That said the tight tie between landform and tiling strategy suggests an approach that can establish a more direct and intuitive link between a primary design driver — the topography — and a secondary design feature that can begin to optimise according to a given landscape condition. In contrast to the two earlier examples where surface development proceeded by transposing a pattern or developing a freeform mesh, here the surface development precedes the application of the parametric geometries, which in turn can inform the underlying surface development. The field-like tiling strategy  responds to iterations in the underlying landform, and takes local variations within the surface as its driver; creating a feedback loop that informs both the 'base' geometry and the tiling strategy itself.
