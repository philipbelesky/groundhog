Enriqueta Llabres and Eduardo Rico's work at the Bartlett identifies a lineage of material computation in design practices, with Frei Otto's work as key "project of extracting logics of distribution and form derived from the careful study of material behaviour".[@Llabres:2014vv 52] In particular they look at his experiments at a territorial level, where he identified large scale organisational patterns in real landscapes and then reproduced these through physical tests that employed self-organising phenomena. As an example, on of these investigations used floating magnets to identify a minimal-energy state of equilibrium within a network while maintaining connectivity between key nodes.[@Llabres:2014vv 53]

While most of Otto's experiments were highly dynamic — i.e. the magnets and needles would push and pull before settling into a steady state — the final equilibrium is still an  endpoint; a 'frozen blueprint' that represents an optimised outcome. [@Llabres:2014vv 54] While dynamic in their 'solving' process the static result nevertheless becomes problematic when modelling many time-based phenomena where a steady-state outcome is rare.

Taking Otto's experiments as a point of departure Enriqueta and Eduardo look to new forms of 'proxi modelling' that better approximate the means by which landscapes  transform in response to natural and designed events.[@Llabres:2014vv 54] One example looks at a Canadian site and the hydrological and geomorphological effects of mineral extraction. Here the mining process has dammed and diverted existing rivers to  capture water for industrial use, which in turn creates new 'trailing pods' and new patterns of sedimentation. The new and disrupted hydrological flows are a starting point for imagining interventions that better re-naturalise these industrial outputs; a process complicated by the dynamic formation of both the new and existing water courses. [@Llabres:2014vv 57]

Physical models, working in conjunction with digital sensing systems, explored these dynamics by simulating the process of delta formation that results when sediment infiltrates slower-moving water bodies:

> "In the physical model generated for the project, water and sediments are dropped from the corner of a tank (assumed upstream) which allows water to flow from the other corner. As the process goes on, layers of sediment will expand away from the corner (Figure 7), generating sedimentation fans and channels that accumulate in layers. ... Experiments are then carried out to evaluate as well as instigate potential interventions and modifications to the main river branches, in this case through the introduction of obstacles to the flow at the point where the first channels begin to emerge." [@Llabres:2014vv 58-59]

The results of these tests were recorded using laser capture and chromatic filtering to create a 3D model that can identify particular patterns in the direction and distance of water flows.[@Llabres:2014vv 59] Designers can then intervene into the form of the model to their understanding of the sedimentary dynamics against both the existing landscape state and against alternative states that introduce new physical formations.[@Llabres:2014vv 59]

There are difficulties in 'miniaturising' such a simulation, in terms of both ensuring the dynamics are correct reflection of the larger scale system[@Llabres:2014vv 55] and in terms of ensuring the sensing techniques are of sufficient resolution to capture small scale changes.[@Llabres:2014vv 61] Nevertheless the hybrid analog/digital system allows the design process to become more intuitive where seeing and modifying a physical model creates causative relationships between complex non-linear phenomena that can be examined and tested with a specificity that well exceeds the designer's understanding.[@Llabres:2014vv 62]

This method is placed in contrast to that of traditional parametric methods of simulation — whereby the advantage of the proxi model is that it is "constantly in flux and shifting, with sand and water changing the overall configuration of the landscape and the urban environment"[@Llabres:2014vv 65] creating a method that is not "just a projective tool purely emanating from the designer."[@Llabres:2014vv 62] To an extent this is a characterisation that derives from the nature of the phenomena investigated and the simulative methods though — parametric models themselves are also capable of rapidly changing their configuration in terms of their initial state and the simulated outcomes. What obstructs this in cases of many hydrological or hydrologically-driven systems is the computationally taxing and irreducible complexity of said fluid phenomena where the simulations are difficult to integrate into a rapid feedback system. Without the ability to quickly test intuitive design decisions against simulations of systems conditions the capabilities of either approach has limits whereby the designer cannot build up an understanding of the phenomena that consciously informs (rather than just validates) design intent.
