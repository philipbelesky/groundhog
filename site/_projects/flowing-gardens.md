A number of projects use similar parametric geometries at greater scales to explore, if not answer, these questions. Often these parametric techniques take shape as tiling strategies or path configurations that feature branching, flowing, twisting, folding, or fracturing geometries. Such forms echo architectural applications of surface panelling and manipulation techniques, but apply them to the ground plane — façades turned into fields.

These formal typologies are often the 'procedural artefacts' of digital design technologies — recognisable patterns that reflect their enabling tools or methodologies.[@Hansen:2011tka] Here, in the design for the Flowing Gardens project, the fractured nature of the landscape surfaces is both an aesthetic marker and procedural trace: the triangulated patterns reflects the mesh-based methods of geometric representation underpinning the design *as well as* a desire to produce forms that reflect a highly dynamic and differentiated landscape condition. Similarly the 'field' aesthetic identified in the previous project acts as both a signifier of parametrically-defined geometry and the designer's desire to create an amorphous atmosphere full of subtle formal shifts.

Plasma Studio and Groundlab's *Flowing Gardens* is a large-scale revitalisation project that replaced a desolate and polluted industrial landscape. In plan it organises through branching meshes that propose a unification of pedestrian and water circulation into a "biomorphic rhizomatic distribution system."[@Winstanley:2012ut] The logic of this unified system is difficult to discern in the final proposal, in part due to the brief's dramatic underestimation of visitor numbers and the designer's difficulty in developing the proposal after the competition win:

> "As a competition entry we handed in a sketch," says Holger Kehne, "because we did not have much time. It was more a vision, a collage with bits of information. As we were not satisfied with our proposal, it surprised us to hear we had won. We believed it was a great opportunity to start over again. But we had to stick to what we had initially proposed."" [@deMuynck:2011ua]

Nevertheless the project is noted for its aesthetic of fractured and branching forms, even if the degree to which these function as an operative and dynamic wetland is curtailed. Regardless of its realisation, there is a question of to what extent the triangulated form work is a logical response to the identified issues of the "hydrological recycling system where water run-off is collected and cleaned naturally before being used for irrigation or discharged into the lake."[@Winstanley:2012ut] Such a form is relatively straightforward to deploy in terms of its geometry — likely a series of points linked with a Delaunay triangulation — but the placement of those points has a massive influence on the resulting design and its resulting performance. This raises a question: given parametric geometries are used to conduct highly complicated forms in a landscape context, to what extent can they provide information about — or begin to optimise themselves towards — functional criteria?
