The need for such precision at such scale in Max Lab IV in part stemmed from the demands of its unique brief. Similar stipulations are more often found in smaller scales with harder materials where fabrication challenges drive the adoption of digital modeling.

The Diana Princess of Wales Memorial is an early example of this, with extensive and exact surface modelling required to produce documentation for fabricators and to refine the design against a specified performance criteria. This workflow involved translating geometry from Rhino into specialised formats for the CNC machines of the stone masons; while also creating a scale model in hard foam to test how the surface's form and texture interacted with the water's flow.

> "Yet, too often landscape architecture design projects are written with minimal reference to materiality and construction, thereby masking many moments of innovation and technological advancement ... the graphic representation of design projects, overwhelmingly emphasise the conceptual or the evocative final renders over design processes and construction details." [@Walliss:2016vy xxi]

The project is an example of how a greater engagement with fabricators and geometry documentation can deliver high-quality results in landscape architecture; however in most cases the domain knowledge to do so pre-exists given the substantial research and practice in architecture, industrial design, and other fields. To the extent this research is about expanding computational practices that are domain-specific to landscape design, techniques for developing and documenting 'hard' materials[^hard] are relatively well-served by existing knowledge; or would lead to knowledge that is more widely applicable beyond landscape practice in designing the built environment.
