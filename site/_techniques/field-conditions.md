The notion of a 'field condition' came the fore of both architecture and landscape architecture over the course of the 'digital turn' and the emergence of landscape urbanism throughout the 90's and early 2000's.[@Llabres:2014vv 64] To follow Stan Allen's *From Object to Field*, field conditions are:

> "...any formal or spatial matrix capable of unifying diverse elements while respecting the identity of each. Field configurations are loosely bounded aggregates characterised by porosity and local interconnectivity. The internal regulations of the parts are decisive; overall shape and extent are highly fluid. Field conditions are bottom-up phenomena: defined not by overarching geometrical schemas but by intricate local connection" [@Allen1997 24]

Unlike the hierarchical patterns of classicism or the minimal montages of modernism, the field condition as a compositional strategy rejects hierarchical orders and imposed rules in favour of an ability to "respond fluidly and sensitively to local difference while maintaining overall stability."[@Allen1997 27] Such a condition is identified in a number of both designed and emergent phenomena: in the Cordoba Mosque, Corbusier's Venice Hospital design; in Renzo Piano's tectonics; in Barry Le Va's sculpture; in the flocking of birds; and in the warped Jeffersonian grids of Midwestern towns or the poly-centric spread of Tokyo.[@Allen1997 25-29]

The descriptions of urban phenomena (particularly urban growth) as a field condition are one of the enduring impacts of this notion within landscape architecture, wherein the distinctions between architectural and landscape conditions collapse when considered as instances of unified process of continuous differentiation.[@Moloney:2011bd 219] Considering sites in this manner was seen as better registering the complexity and dynamism of landscape systems; particularly given contemporary patterns of urbanism
that move away from strict spatial and geometric orders and towards other methods of organisation.[@Barnett:2013tw 69]

The second enduring impact is in how the concept helps re-evaluate figure-ground relationships in mapping. Considered as a field, the figure is understood "not as a demarcated object but as an effect emerging from the field itself — as moments of intensity; as peaks or valleys."[@Allen1997 28] This approach has lead to strategies that seek to employ the field condition as a generative or analytic device, primarily in plan, as evident in a number of graphic techniques:[^ghn]

[^ghn]: It's worth noting that the popularity of many of the techniques below occured in tandem with the popularity of NURBs- and parametric- based modelling. Grid deformations tie closely to topological surface modelling; while vector, heat-map, differentiated geometries, and the like are easier to achieve using parametric methods.

- The use of gradiented heat-map style visual representations that depict site conditions along a colour spectrum that is then overlaid and spread across a spatial extent in a diffuse manner.
- The use of a visual pattern whose geometric shape shifts subtly in response to spatial conditions; such as using a grid of circles whose radii expand or contract over the course of a site in response to particular points of interest.
- The use of vector diagrams to measure site information; often paired with variable-length or coloured arrows to display site information that has both a spatial direction (say the movement of air) as well as a given magnitude.
- Allowing the grid to transform and transfigure in relationship to the spatial systems embedded in a site so that it can be appropriated as a structure for generating novelty rather than enforcing order.[@Monacella:2011vp 44]

In each case the graphic symbols employed attempt to — as much as is possible within a primarily graphic medium — shift away from strictly demarcated geometries towards more distributed and diffuse modes of representation. This parallels a distinction often discussed in relation to field conditions: that of intensive conditions and extensive conditions. In the original (thermodynamics) sense an extensive material property is one that is proportional to quantity: the mass or volume of an object will reduce if that object is divided whereas an intensive properties — such as temperature or density — would not.[@DeLanda:2006uy 152] When talking about more general types of phenomena, rather than individual properties, intensive conditions are described as those that drive or exhibit dynamism, such as meteorological conditions that flux according to constant shifts in pressure differences, air movement, or temperature fronts.[@DeLanda:2006uy 152] Such "mobile and productive" differences setup a kind of map/territory distinction whereby underpinning intensive conditions — say that of lithospheric lava movements — produce extensive measures — landform.[@DeLanda:2006uy 152] Traditional forms of mapping document extensive phenomena (by geometrically extensive means) that are the results of these underpinning processes wheras more 'intensive' modes of mapping can begin to "show the process itself."[@DeLanda:2006uy 152]

Complicating this distinction is a characterisation of design strategies and graphic techniques as themselves emblematic of an intensive or extensive process. Codified systems of documentation and drawing — plans, sections, elevations — can be characterised as self-limiting techniques for "domesticating matter within metric space" whose geometric rigour is required for clear communication.[@Reiser:2009tz 80] In contrast, the lack of constraints found in a sketch[@Reiser:2009tz 80] or the diagram[@Reiser:2009tz 122] render it as methods for intensive exploration; whose expressions can be then be translated and evaluated against the constraints of codified techniques. An interplay between intensive and extensive modes of design exploration are often desirable, such as stepping between a plan and a exploratory physical model, as the differences in mode create a reciprocity where the "creative tendency of intensive fields and the codifying tendency of extensive fields do not merely work in succession."[@Reiser:2009tz 80]

As in analogue media, the role of geometry in digital models acts as a regulator of intensive material conditions; as a way of delimiting their properties into a particular fixed scalar, temporal, and spatial limit.[@Reiser:2009tz 80] At the same time, most digital models can be seen as more extensive in their codification of these properties: they are assemblages of data organised according to highly structured and inflexible properties that define geometric types such as that of a `Surface` or `Mesh`. While parametric modelling would be considered as extensive (if not more so) than standard forms of geometric modelling in terms of their implementation and codification, the malleability of that codification (as assemblages of parametric relationships) can enable a generative intensity as previously-fixed geometric properties become dynamic from the perspective of the modeller.
