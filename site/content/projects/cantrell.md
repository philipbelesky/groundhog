<!-- TODO: nail down which project to show/discuss  -->

Bradley Cantrell identifies his work as tools that engage "in a process of feedback, a conversation between two actors," that allow for the landscape architect to better understand and react to a given environment.[@Cantrell:2015tf  Section 2 para 1] In the example presented here, a model of landscape form is constituted of fine particles that serves as a testing bed for examining hydrological conditions. To do so, water jets direct flows across the artificial landscape, as overhead sensors record the resulting changes and re-represent them in a digital model. This digital model acts as a store of previous iterations, and can 'dial-in' digital simulations by validating their predictions against real world results.

<!-- TODO: actual details of what Brad is doing -->

This approach is particularly effective for many classes of hydrological phenomena because they enact simulations of fluid dynamics; a process that is difficult to do digitally, particularly in the context of simulating landscape form at landscape scales. While there may be some changes in behaviour between the model and real scale, the basic behaviour at least reflects the chosen phenomena. Similar necessities drive the use of wind-tunnel tests in architecture and other design disciplines.

However there are limits to what phenomena *can be* or *need to be* simulated using physical modelling. Biological phenomena can be measured and tested for design purposes, such as say the phytoremediative potential of a given species, but for these results to drive design iterations (rather than merely validate a design proposal) there needs to be that conversational dialogue where new results can be generated to gauge new design features. For biological phenomena, such as say a species' growth rates given a particular shading or soil condition, the time required to simulate these phenomena cannot be greatly accelerated and so are too slow to assist in rapid design iteration.

Similarly the setup costs, both of the initial model, and of each simulated iteration are high. Creating and setting up the sensor networks and linking them to digital models requires a high degree of expertise, with sensor and software setup likely explicitly tied to the conditions investigated. Physically creating a model, particularly if it is to represent a real-world location is difficult, and often the course of each test requires that the model is reset to this base form if the tests have physical effects — such as with simulations of erosion.

<!-- TODO figure out what this means: These manual setup factors preclude auto-catalytic loops in optimisation. -->

As a result the use of analogue computation seems relative niche. It remains one of the best — if not only — method for modelling many classes of phenomena where digital methods are exceedingly slow or inaccurate. Moreover, even if digital methods for modelling such phenomena become more advanced, physical models would likely remain useful as methods for validating results. In the cases of many other landscape phenomena, the simulated action may be unsuitable for physical modelling, either due to scalar or temporal dependencies that cannot be compressed so as to enable easy testing. However, because the use of sensing technologies ties these physical simulations to digital simulations, it is possible to create 'hybrid' models that employ both digital and physical methods for simulation and analysis that can offer the best of both worlds in creating a cohesive understanding of landscape performance.
